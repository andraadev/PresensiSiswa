> **Prerequisites:** Before you start, ensure you have a local development environment (like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed on your system. This project requires **PHP 8.1** or higher.
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andraadev/PresensiSiswa.git
    cd PresensiSiswa
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Setup up the environment file**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    > **Note:** Open the `.env` file and configure your database connection (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).

4.  **Generate the application key**:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

## üî• Known Major Issues
-   **Import Timeout:** Importing Excel files containing more than 30 rows may result in a request timeout.
